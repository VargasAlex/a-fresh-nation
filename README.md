# A-Fresh-Nation

This website uses the USDA National Farmers Market Directory API to retrieve a markets location and name based on a users zip code input. When a user enters a zip code into the input bar, all the farmers market in that area will populate the map as a red marker. A mouse hover over one of the markers will display the markets name.
